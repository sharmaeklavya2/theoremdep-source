        "description": "Let e be an edge crossing a cut of a graph G. Let F be a spanning forest of G which does not contain e. Then we can obtain a different spanning forest of G by replacing an edge in F which crosses the cut by e. Consequently, if e is a light edge of the cut, the weight of the new spanning forest either reduces or stays the same."
