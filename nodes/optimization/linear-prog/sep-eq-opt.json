        "description": "In linear programming, the optimization problem is to find a point with optimal value that satisfies a set of constraints. In the separation problem, given a point, we have to find out if it satisfies all the constraints, and if it doesn't, find a violated constraint. It can be proven that the two problems are polynomial-time reducible to each other via the Ellipsoid algorithm. There are weak versions of the problems which are also equivalent.",
