$\newcommand{\Ical}{\mathcal{I}}$

There exists a fair division instance $\Ical = ([3], [6], V, w)$
with equal entitlements and identical additive valuations,
for which no allocation is PROPm.
Moreover, an allocation $A$ exists for $\Ical$ that is EFX, groupwise MMS, and groupwise APS.

## Proof

Let the items have values $(-3, -3, -3, -3, -3, 3ε)$, where $0 < ε < 1/2$.
The proportional share is $v([m])/3 = -5 + ε$.

Without loss of generality, assume agent 1 receives the most number of chores,
and agent 3 receives the least number of chores.
Then agent 1 has at least 2 chores, and agent 3 has at most 1 chore.

### Case 1: agent 1 receives at least 3 chores.

Then even after removing one of her chores, and even if she receives the good,
her value for her bundle is at most $-6 + 3ε < -5 + ε$.
Hence, she is not PROPm-satisfied.

### Case 2: agent 1 receives 2 chores.

Then agent 2 also receives 2 chores, and agent 3 receives 1 chore.
Assume without loss of generality that agent 2 receives the good.
Then this allocation is EFX and groupwise MMS.
On setting the price of each chore to -3 and the price of the good to 3,
we get that the allocation is groupwise APS.

Now if agent 1 adds the good to her bundle, her value becomes $-6 + 3ε < -5 + ε$.
Hence, she is not PROPm-satisfied.
