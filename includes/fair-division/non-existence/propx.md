Consider a fair division instance with 3 agents with equal entitlements and identical additive valuations.
There are 2 goods of values 5 and 1. Then no PROPx allocation exists.

Let $A$ be the allocation where the first agent gets the good of value 5,
and the second agent gets the good of value 1.
Then $A$ is a groupwise APS allocation.

## Proof

In every allocation, some agent doesn't get any good. That agent is not PROPx-satisfied.

Set the price of the goods to $1.1$ and $0.9$. This shows that $A$ is groupwise APS.
