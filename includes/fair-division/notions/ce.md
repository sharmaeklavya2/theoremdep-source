Let $(N, M, V, w)$ be a fair division instance of goods, let $A$ be a (complete) allocation,
and let $p: 2^M \to \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$ be an additive function.
The pair $(A, p)$ is called a *competitive equilibrium* (CE) if for every agent $i \in N$,
\[ v_i(A_i) = \sup_{X: p_i(X) ≤ w_i} v_i(X). \]
$A$ is called a CE allocation if $(A, p)$ is a CE for some $p$.

Let $(N, M, V, w)$ be a fair division instance of chores, let $A$ be a (complete) allocation,
and let $p: 2^M \to \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$ be an additive function.
The pair $(A, p)$ is called a *competitive equilibrium* (CE) if for every agent $i \in N$,
\[ d_i(A_i) = \inf_{X: p_i(X) ≥ w_i} d_i(X). \]
$A$ is called a CE allocation if $(A, p)$ is a CE for some $p$.
