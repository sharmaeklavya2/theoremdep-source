In fair division of indivisible goods, an agent $i$ having entitlement $w_i$
is PROPx satisfied if either $v_i(A_i) ≥ w_iv_i(M)$ or
$v_i(A_i \cup \{g\}) > w_iv_i(M)$ for all $g \in M \setminus A_i$.

In fair division of indivisible chores, an agent $i$ having entitlement $w_i$
is PROPx satisfied if either $d_i(A_i) ≤ w_id_i(M)$ or
$d_i(A_i \setminus \{c\}) < w_id_i(M)$ for all $c \in A_i$.
