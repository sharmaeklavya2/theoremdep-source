Let $A = (A_1, \ldots, A_n)$ be a (partial) allocation in a fair division instance.
Let $w = (w_1, \ldots, w_n)$ be the vector of entitlements. Then

* Agent $i$ envies agent $j$ in $A$ iff $v_i(A_i)/w_i < v_i(A_j)/w_j$.
* Agent $i$ is envy-free (EF) in $A$ iff $i$ doesn't envy anyone.
* $A$ is envy-free (EF) iff all agents are envy-free in $A$.
