Let $([n], M, V, w)$ be a fair division instance of indivisible items,
and let $A$ be an allocation.

Agent $i$ is MXS-satisfied by $A$ if there is another allocation $B$
where $i$ is EFX-satisfied and $v_i(A_i) ≥ v_i(B_i)$.
Agent $i$ is MXS<sub>0</sub>-satisfied by $A$ if there is another allocation $B$
where $i$ is EFX<sub>0</sub>-satisfied and $v_i(A_i) ≥ v_i(B_i)$.
