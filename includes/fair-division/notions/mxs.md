Let $([n], M, V, w)$ be a fair division instance of indivisible items,
and let $A$ be an allocation.

Agent $i$ is MXS-satisfied by $A$ if there is another allocation $B$
(called agent $i$'s MXS-certificate for $A$)
where $i$ is EFX-satisfied and $v_i(A_i) â‰¥ v_i(B_i)$.

The minimum value agent $i$ receives among all allocations where she doesn't EFX-envy anyone
is called her minimum EFX share (MXS). Equivalently, an allocation $A$ is MXS-fair to agent $i$
if her value for her bundle is at least her minimum EFX share.
