In fair division, let $F$ be a fairness notion.
An allocation $A$ is said to be epistemic-$F$-fair to an agent $i$ if
there exists another allocation $B$ such that
$A_i = B_i$ and $B$ is $F$-fair for agent $i$.

Here $B$ is called agent $i$'s epistemic-$F$-certificate for $A$.
Note that in an epistemic-$F$-fair allocation,
different agents can have different certificates.
