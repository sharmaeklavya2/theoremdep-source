For a fair division instance $(N, M, V, w)$ and allocation $A$,

* the social welfare is $\sum_{i=1}^n w_iv_i(A_i)$.
    $A$ is called social-welfare-optimal if it maximizes the social welfare.
* the Nash social welfare is $\prod_{i=1}^n v_i(A_i)^{w_i}$.
    $A$ is called maximum Nash welfare (MNW) or Nash optimal (NO, NashOpt)
    if it maximizes the Nash social welfare.
* the egalitarian welfare is $\min_{i=1}^n \frac{v_i(A_i)}{w_i}$.
