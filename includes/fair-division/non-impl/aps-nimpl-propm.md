Consider a fair division instance with 3 agents having equal entitlements and identical additive valuations.
There are 6 goods of values 6, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1. Let $A = (\{3\}, \{1, 1, 1\}, \{6, 1\})$.
Then $A$ is APS and MMS but not PROPm.

## Proof

It's easy to see that the MMS is 3. Hence, the APS is at least 3.
On setting the prices as 4, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, we get that the APS is at most 3.
Hence, $A$ is APS and MMS.

The proportional share is $13/3 > 4$, so $A$ is not PROPm.
