Let $t \in \{-1, 1\}$.
Consider a fair division instance with 2 agents having equal entitlements and identical additive valuations.
Let there be 2 items of value $4t$ and 5 items of value $t$.
Then the allocation $A = (\{4t, t\}, \{4t, t, t, t, t\})$ is not PROPx or EFX,
but it is MXS because the agents have $(\{t, t, t, t, t\}, \{4t, 4t\})$
and $(\{4t, 4t\}, \{t, t, t, t, t\})$ as their certificates for $A$.
