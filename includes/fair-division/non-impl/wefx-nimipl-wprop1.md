Consider a fair division instance $([n], [m], V, w)$,
where $n=3$, $m=7$, and $w = (3/5, 1/5, 1/5)$.
The agents have identical additive valuations, and all items are goods of value 1 each.

The allocation $A$ where $|A_1| = 3$ and $|A_2| = |A_3| = 2$ is EFX but not PROP1.

(Agent 1 is the only envious agent. Her proportional share is $7 \times (3/5) = 4.2$,
but after adding a good to her bundle, her value is $4$.)
