Consider a fair division instance with 15 goods and 3 agents having equal entitlements
and identical additive valuations. The values of the goods are
65, 31, 31, 31, 23, 23, 23, 17, 11, 7, 7, 7, 5, 5, 5.
Then a GMMS allocation exists but an APS alloction doesn't exist.

Even for the instance of chores obtained by multiplying every good's value by $-1$,
a GMMS allocation exists but an APS alloction doesn't exist.

## Proof

For these instances, the leximin allocation is GMMS.
However, APS $>$ MMS for both these instances,
and the minimum value across all bundles is at most the MMS,
so no APS allocation exists.
