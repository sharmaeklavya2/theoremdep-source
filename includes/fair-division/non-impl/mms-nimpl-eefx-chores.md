Consider a fair division instance with 3 agents with identical additive utilities and equal entitlements,
and 5 chores of disutilities $(β, 1, 1, 1, ε)$, where $0 < ε < 1$ and $1 < β < 2-ε$.
Then $X = (\{β, ε\}, \{1, 1\}, \{1\})$ is an MMS allocation but not an epistemic EFX allocation.

## Proof

Let $X = (\{β, ε\}, \{1, 1\}, \{1\})$.
Here, everyone's disutility is at most 2.
Morever, no allocation gives disutility less than 2 to everyone
(because then no agent should get two chores of disutility 1,
so each agent gets a a single chore of disutility 1,
and then whoever gets $β$ would have disutility more than 2).
Hence, the maximin share is $-2$ and $X$ is an MMS allocation.

In every allocation $Y$ where $Y_1 = X_1$, some agent has the bundle $\{1\}$.
Hence, agent 1 doesn't have an epistemic-EFX-certificate for $X$.
