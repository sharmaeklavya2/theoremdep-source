Consider a fair division instance having $n ≥ 3$ agents
having equal entitlements and identical additive valuations,
and $m = 2n-1$ goods, each of value 1.
Let $A$ be an allocation where agent $n$ gets $n$ goods,
and all other agents get 1 good each.
Then this allocation is APS, MMS, and PROPx, but not EF1.

## Proof

$1 = \MMS_i ≤ \APS_i ≤ v([m])/n = 2 - 1/n$.
Hence, $APS_i = 1$, since the APS is the value of some bundle.
Hence, $A$ is APS, MMS, and PROPx.

$A$ is not EF1 because the first $n-1$ agents EF1-envy agent $n$.
