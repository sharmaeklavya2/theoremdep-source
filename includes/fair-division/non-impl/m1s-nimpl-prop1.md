Let $t \in \{-1, 1\}$.
Consider a fair division instance with 2 agents having equal entitlements and identical additive valuations.
There are 9 items, and $v(9) = 4t$ and $v(j) = t$ for $j \in [8]$.
Let $A$ be an allocation where $A_1 = \{9\}$.
Then for all $t \in \{-1, 1\}$, $A$ is M1S but not PROP1.

## Proof

$v([m])/2 = 6t$. Let $B = ([4], [9] \setminus [4])$.

For $t = 1$ (goods), $B$ is agent 1's M1S-certificate for $A$,
but agent 1 is not PROP1-satisfied by $A$.

For $t = -1$ (chores), $B$ is agent 2's M1S-certificate for $A$,
but agent 2 is not PROP1-satisfied by $A$.
