Consider a fair division instance with 3 agents having equal entitlements and identical additive valuations.
Let there be 2 chores of disutility $4$ each (big chores) and 10 chores of disutility $1$ each (small chores).
Let $A$ be an allocation where agent 1 has 8 small chores,
agent 2 has a big chore and a small chore, and agent 3 has a big chore and a small chore.
Then $A$ is MXS, but agent 1 is not PROP1-satisfied.

## Proof

The proportional share is $-6$, so agent 1 is not PROP1-satisfied by $A$.

Let $B$ be an allocation where agent 1 has both big chores,
and agents 2 and 3 have 5 small chores each.
Then $d(B_i) = d(A_i)$ for every agent $i$, and each agent is EFX-satisifed in $B$.
Hence, $B$ is every agent's MXS certificate for $A$.
Hence, $A$ is an MXS allocation.
