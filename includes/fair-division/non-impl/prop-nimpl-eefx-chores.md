Consider the problem of fairly dividing 12 additive bivalued chores among 3 agents.
Agent 1 has disutility 7 for each of the first 3 chores,
and disutility 1 for each remaining chore.
Agents 2 and 3 have disuitlity 1 for each chore.
Then $A \defeq ([12] \setminus [3], [2], \{3\})$ is a PROP allocation
where agent 1 is not epistemic-EFX-satisfied.

## Proof

$\PROP_1 = 10$, and agent 1's disutility for her bundle is 9, so she is PROP-satisfied.
$\PROP_2 = \PROP_3 = 4$, so agents 2 and 3 are also PROP-satisfied.

Agent 1 is not epistemic-EFX-satisfied by $A$, since in any epistemic-EFX-certificate $B$,
some agent $j \in \{2, 3\}$ receives at most one chore of value 7,
and agent 1 would strongly envy $j$.
