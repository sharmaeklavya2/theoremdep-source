Let $t \in \{-1, 1\}$.
Consider a fair division instance with 2 agents having equal entitlements and identical additive valuations.
Let there be 5 items of values $3t$, $3t$, $2t$, $2t$, and $2t$.
Let $A \defeq (\{3t, 2t\}, \{3t, 2t, 2t\})$. Then $A$ is EFX but not MMS.

## Proof

The MMS is $6t$, since $P = (\{3t, 3t\}, \{2t, 2t, 2t\})$ is an MMS partition.
But in $A$, some agent doesn't get her MMS.
