Consider a fair division instance having $n ≥ 3$ agents
having equal entitlements and identical additive valuations,
and $m = n+1$ chores, each of disutility 1.
Let $A$ be an allocation where agents 1 and 2 gets 2 chores each,
agent $n$ gets 0 chores, and the remaining agents get 1 chore each.
Then this allocation is APS, MMS, and epistemic EFX, but not EF1.

## Proof

$-2 = \MMS_i ≤ \APS_i ≤ v([m])/n = - 1 - 1/n$.
Hence, $APS_i = -2$, since the APS is the value of some bundle.
Hence, $A$ is APS and MMS.

Agents $[n] \setminus \{2\}$ do not EFX-envy anyone in $A$.
Agent 1's epistemic-EFX-certificate can be obtained by
transferring a chore from agent 2 to agent $n$.
Agent 2's epistemic-EFX-certificate can be obtained by
transferring a chore from agent 1 to agent $n$.
Hence, $A$ is epistemic EFX.

$A$ is not EF1 because agents 1 and 2 EF1-envy agent $n$.
