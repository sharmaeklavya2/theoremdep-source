In fair division with identical superadditive valuations,
a PROP allocation is also an EF allocation.
This is true even for unequal entitlements.

## Proof

Let $A$ be a PROP allocation. Then for each agent $i$, we have $v(A_i) â‰¥ w_iv(M)$.
Suppose $v(A_k) > w_kv(M)$ for some agent $k$.
Sum these inequalities to get $\sum_{i=1}^n v(A_i) > v(M)$.
This contradicts superadditivity of $v$, so $v(A_i) = w_iv(M)$ for each agent $i$.
Hence, $v(A_i)/w_i = v(M)$ for all $i$, so $A$ is EF.
