In fair division of indivisible goods with two agents,
if an agent is MMS-satisfied and has positive marginal value for every good,
then she is also EFX-satisfied.

## Proof

Let $(P_1, P_2)$ be the agent 1's MMS partition, where $v_1(P_1) ≤ v_1(P_2)$.
Assume that in allocation $(A_1, A_2)$, agent 1 is MMS-satisfied but not EFX-satisfied.
Then $v_1(P_1) ≤ v_1(A_1) < v_1(A_2 \setminus \{g\})$ for some $g \in A_2$.

Let $B = (A_1 \cup \{g\}, A_2 \setminus \{g\})$.
Since agent 1 has positive marginal value for every good, we get $v_1(B_1) > v_1(A_1) ≥ v_1(P_1)$
and $v_1(B_2) = v_1(A_2 \setminus \{g\}) > v_1(P_1)$.
Hence, in $B$, both bundles have value more than $v_1(P_1)$.
This contradicts the fact that $P$ is an MMS partition for agent 1.
Hence, it's not possible for agent 1 to be MMS-satisfied but not EFX-satisfied.
