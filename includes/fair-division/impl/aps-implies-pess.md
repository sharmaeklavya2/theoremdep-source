For any fair division instance of indivisible items and any agent $i$,
we have $\APS_i â‰¥ \pessShare_i$.
Hence, if $i$ is APS-satisfied, then she is also pessShare-satisfied.

## Proof

Proposition 2 of <https://doi.org/10.1287/moor.2021.0199>.
(Although this part of the paper only considers the goods case,
the proof works for mixed manna too.)
