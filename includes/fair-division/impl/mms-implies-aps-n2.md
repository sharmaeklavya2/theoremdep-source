Let $([2], [m], V, w)$ be a fair division instance with indivisible items and equal entitlements.
If $v_i$ is additive for some agent $i$, then $\APS_i = \MMS_i$.

## Proof

Let $\beta_i \defeq \max(\{v_i(S): S \subseteq [m] \textrm{ and } v_i(S) ≤ v_i([m])/2\})$.
Then $\beta_i = \MMS_i ≤ \APS_i ≤ v_i([m])/2$.
Hence, $\APS_i = \beta_i = \MMS_i$.
