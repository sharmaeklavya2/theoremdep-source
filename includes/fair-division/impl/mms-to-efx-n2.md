Consider a fair division instance $([2], [m], V, w)$ of indivisible items
(where each agent $i$ has entitlement $w_i$).
Suppose an allocation $A$ is WMMS-fair to agent 1.
Then $A$ is also EFX-fair to agent 1 if one of these conditions hold:

1.  The items are goods to agent 1.
2.  $v_1$ is additive and $w_1 â‰¤ w_2$.

## Proof

If agent 1 doesn't envy agent 2, she is EFX-satisfied.
Otherwise, she is EFX-satisfied because of
