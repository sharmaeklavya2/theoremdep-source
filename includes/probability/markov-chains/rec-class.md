Let $X = [X_0, X_1, \ldots]$ be a markov chain with transition function $P$.
Suppose state $i$ is transient and states $i$ and $j$ communicate.
Then $j$ is also recurrent.

This implies that either all states of a state class are recurrent,
or no state in the class is recurrent.
We call a class recurrent iff all states in the class are recurrent.
