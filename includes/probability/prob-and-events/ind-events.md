Events $A$ and $B$ are said to be independent for the probability measure $\Pr$
iff $\Pr(A \cap B) = \Pr(A)\Pr(B)$.

It is easy to see that independence is a symmetric relation.

If for event $C$, $\Pr_{|C}$ is defined and $A$ and $B$ are independent for $\Pr_{|C}$,
then $A$ and $B$ are said to be independent conditioned on $C$.

Let $S = \{A_1, A_2, \ldots\}$ be a countable set of events.
Then events in $S$ are said to be independent iff
\[ \Pr\left(\bigcap_{A \in S} A\right) = \prod_{A \in S} \Pr(A) \]
The events in $S$ are said to be pairwise independent iff
any 2 distinct events in $S$ are independent.
