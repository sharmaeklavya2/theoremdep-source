Let $(\Omega, F, \Pr)$ be a probability space.
Let $(D, E)$ be a $\sigma$-algebra.
Let $X$ and $Y$ be random variables from $(\Omega, F, \Pr)$ to $(D, E)$.

$X$ is said to be independent from $A \in F$ iff
\[ \forall B \in E, \; \Pr(X \in B \mid A) = \Pr(X \in B) \]

$X$ is said to be independent from $Y$ iff
\[ \forall B \in E, \; \forall C \in E, \; \Pr(X \in B \mid Y \in C) = \Pr(X \in B) \]
