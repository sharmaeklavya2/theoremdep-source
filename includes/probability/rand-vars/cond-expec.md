Let $X$ be a random variable on $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \Pr)$ and $A$ be an event.
Then $\E(X \mid A)$ is the same as $\E(X)$,
except that the probability measure for the Lebesgue integral
is $\Pr_{|A}$ instead of $\Pr$.

Let $X$ be a real-valued random variable, and $Y$ be a random variable.
Define $g(y) = \E(X \mid Y=y)$. Then $\E(X \mid Y)$ is defined as the random variable $g(Y)$.
