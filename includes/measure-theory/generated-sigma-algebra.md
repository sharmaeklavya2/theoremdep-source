Let $F$ be a subset of the power-set of $X$.

Define $\sigma(F)$ as the set containing all the subsets of $X$
that can be made from elements of $F$ by a countable number of
complement, union and intersection operations. Then $\sigma(F)$ is a $\sigma$-algebra.

The proof follows almost by definition.

$\sigma(F)$ is called the '$\sigma$-algebra generated by $F$'.
