Let $M = (S, I)$ be a matroid and let $X \subseteq S$.
Then $B$ is a basis of $X$ iff both these conditions hold:

* Independence: $B \in I$.
* Maximality: $\forall x \in X-B, B + x \not\in I$.

When $X = S$, we say that $B$ is a basis of $M$.

The plural of 'basis' is 'bases'. 'Base' is a synonym for basis.
