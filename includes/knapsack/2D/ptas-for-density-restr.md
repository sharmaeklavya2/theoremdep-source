Consider items in a 2D geometric knapsack problem.
The density of an item is the ratio of its profit to its area.
Let $\lambda$ be the ratio of the maximum density of an item to the minimum density of an item.
If we only consider instances for which $\lambda$ is upper-bounded by a constant,
then there is a PTAS for this variant of the knapsack problem.
