Let $I$ be an ideal of $\mathbb{Z}$.
Then $I$ is a principal ideal, i.e. $I$ is of the form $n\mathbb{Z}$ for some $n \in \mathbb{Z}$.

## Proof

Let $n$ be the smallest positive element of $I$.
Let $a \in I$.

By the integer division theorem, $a = qn + r$, where $0 \le r \lt n$.
$r = a - qn \in I$ by absorption and commutativity.
Since $r \in I$, $r < n$ and $n$ is the smallest positive element of $I$, $r = 0$.

Therefore, every element of $I$ is a multiple of $n$.
Also, all multiples of $n$ are in $I$ by the absorption property.

Therefore, $I = n\mathbb{Z}$.
