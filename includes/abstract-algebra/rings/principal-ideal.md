Let $R$ be a ring and $a \in R$.
Let $aR = \{ar: r \in R\}$.
Then $aR$ is a right ideal.
Such an ideal is called a principal ideal.

Similarly, $Ra$ is a left ideal.

If $R$ is commutative, $aR = Ra$ is a 2-sided ideal.

## Proof

Let $ar_1, ar_2 \in aR$.

* $0 = a0 \in aR \Rightarrow aR \neq \{\}$.
* $ar_1 - ar_2 = a(r_1 - r_2) \in aR$ (by distributivity).
* $(ar_1)(ar_2) = a(r_1ar_2) \in aR$

Therefore, $aR$ is a subring of $R$.

$(ar)x = a(rx) \in aR$. Therefore, $aR$ is a right ideal.

Similarly it can be proved that $Ra$ is a left ideal.

When $R$ is commutative,
\[ aR = \{ar: r \in R\} = \{ra: r \in R\} = Ra \]
Therefore, $aR$ is a 2-sided ideal.
