$(R, +, \circ)$ is a ring iff all of the following conditions are met:

* $(R, +)$ is an abelian group (identity is denoted as 0).
* Closure of multiplication: $\forall a, b \in R, ab \in R$.
* Associativity of multiplication: $\forall a, b, c \in R, (ab)c = a(bc)$.
* Distributive property: $\forall a, b, c \in R, (a(b+c) = ab+ac \wedge (a+b)c = ac+bc)$.
