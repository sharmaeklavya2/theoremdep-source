$(R, +, \circ)$ is a ring iff all of the following conditions are met
(here $ab$ means $a \circ b$):

* $(R, +)$ is a commutative group (identity is denoted as 0).
* Closure of multiplication: $\forall a, b \in R, ab \in R$.
* Associativity of multiplication: $\forall a, b, c \in R, (ab)c = a(bc)$.
* Distributive property: $\forall a, b, c \in R, (a(b+c) = ab+ac \wedge (a+b)c = ac+bc)$.

A ring is said to be commutative if the $\circ$ operator is commutative.

Common examples of commutative rings are
$(\mathbb{Q}, +, \times)$, $(\mathbb{R}, +, \times)$ and $(\mathbb{C}, +, \times)$
(it is trivial to prove that they are commutative rings).
