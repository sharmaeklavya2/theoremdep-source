The ring $(R, +, \circ)$ is a field iff all of the following conditions are met:

* $(R, +)$ is a commutative group (identity is denoted as 0).
* $(R - \{0\}, \circ)$ is a commutative group (identity is denoted as 1).
* Distributive property: $\forall a, b, c \in R, (a(b+c) = ab+ac \wedge (a+b)c = ac+bc)$.

Consequently, a field is also a commutative ring.

Also, a field has at least 2 elements, 0 and 1.

Common examples of fields are
$(\mathbb{Q}, +, \times)$, $(\mathbb{R}, +, \times)$ and $(\mathbb{C}, +, \times)$
(it is trivial to prove that they are fields).
