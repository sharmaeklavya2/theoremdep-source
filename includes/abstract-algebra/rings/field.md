$(R, +, \circ)$ is a field iff all of the following conditions are met:

* $(R, +)$ is an abelian group (identity is denoted as 0).
* $(R, \circ)$ is an abelian group (identity is denoted as 1).
* Distributive property: $\forall a, b, c \in R, (a(b+c) = ab+ac \wedge (a+b)c = ac+bc)$.

Consequently, a field is also a ring.

Also, a field has at least 2 elements, 0 and 1.
