Let $\lambda_\tau(\sigma) = \tau\sigma$, where $\tau$ is a transposition.

$\lambda_\tau$ is a bijection from the set of even permutations to the set of odd permutations.

## Proof

$ \textrm{Let } \lambda_\tau(\sigma_1) = \lambda_\tau(\sigma_2) \implies \tau\sigma_1 = \tau\sigma_2 \implies \sigma_1 = \tau^{-1}\tau\sigma_2 = \sigma_2 $

Therefore, $\lambda_\tau$ is one-to-one.

Let $\mu$ be an odd permutation.
Then $\lambda_\tau(\mu) = \tau\mu$ is an even permutation.

$\lambda_\tau(\lambda_\tau(\mu)) = \tau\tau\mu = \mu$.
So $\mu$ has an even permutation as a pre-image in $\lambda_\tau$.
Therefore, $\lambda_\tau$ is onto.

Therefore, $\lambda_\tau$ is a bijection from even permutations to odd permutations.
