Every finite permutation can be written as a product of transpositions.

## Proof

The cycle $(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n)$ can as a product of transpositions in many ways.
Here are two ways of doing it:

* $(a_1, a_2)(a_2, a_3)\ldots(a_{n-2}, a_{n-1})(a_{n-1}, a_n)$
* $(a_1, a_n)(a_1, a_{n-1})\ldots(a_1, a_3)(a_1, a_2)$

Since every permutation can be written as a product of disjoint cycles,
every permutation can be written as a product of transpositions.
