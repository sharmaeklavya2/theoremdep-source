Canonical cycle notation is a unique way of writing a permutation as a product of disjoint cycles.

This works when the set on which the permutation is defined is orderable.

The canonical representation of a cycle is when the smallest element
of the cycle is written as the first element of the cycle.

A permutation can be written as a product of a unique set of disjoint cycles.
Sort the cycles based on the smallest element of the cycles.
Then write each cycle in its canonical form.

The permutation $(1, 2, 5)(3, 6, 4)$ is in canonical cycle notation.

The permutations $(3, 6, 4)(1, 2, 5)$ and $(1, 2, 5)(6, 4, 3)$ are not in canonical cycle notation.
