Let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$.
Then $|H| \mid |G|$ and number of left cosets of $H$ is $\frac{|G|}{|H|}$.

## Proof

$\operatorname{id}(G) \in H \implies \forall g \in G, g \in gH \implies \bigcup_{g \in G} gH = G$

Therefore, the cosets of $H$ span $G$.

Since all cosets are disjoint, size of each coset is $|H|$ and cosets span $G$,
there are $\frac{|G|}{|H|}$ cosets, each of size $|H|$.

This also implies $|H| \mid |G|$.
