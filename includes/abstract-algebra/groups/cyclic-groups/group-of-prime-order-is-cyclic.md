Let $G$ be a group where $|G|$ is prime.

Since $|G| > 1$, $G$ has an element $g$ which is not identity.
$\operatorname{order}(g) > 1$, because $g$ is not identity.

$\operatorname{order}(g)$ divides $|G|$ and $|G|$ is prime.
Therefore, $\operatorname{order}(g) = |G|$.
This means $g$ is a generator of $G$.

Therefore, a group of prime order is cyclic and all non-identity elements are generators.
