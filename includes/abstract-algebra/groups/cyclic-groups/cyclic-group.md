Let $G$ be a group and $g \in G$.
Then the cyclic subgroup with generator $g$, denoted as $\langle g \rangle$, is $\{g^k: k \in \mathbb{Z}\}$.

A group $G$ is said to be cyclic if $\exists g \in G, \langle g \rangle = G$.

## Proof that $\langle g \rangle$ is a subgroup of $G$

* Closure: $g^i * g^j = g^{i+j} \in \langle g \rangle$.
* Identity of $G$ is $e = g^0 \in \langle g \rangle$.
* Inverse of $g^k$ is $g^{-k}$, because $g^k * g^{-k} = g^{k + (-k)} = g^0 = e$.
