A group G is a set S along with a binary operator $*$ which satisfies certain properties:

* **Closure**: $\forall a \in S, \forall b \in S, a * b \in S$.
* **Associativity**: $\forall a,b,c \in S, (a*b)*c = a*(b*c)$.
* **Existence of Identity**: $\exists e \in S, \forall a \in S, a*e = e*a = a$.
  Such an $e$ is called the identity of $G$ (denoted as $\operatorname{id}(G)$).
  It can be proven that the identity is unique.
* **Existence of Inverses**: $\forall a \in S, (\exists l \in S, l*a = e) \wedge (\exists r \in S, a*r = e)$.
  It can be proven that $l$ is unique, $r$ is unique and $l = r$.
