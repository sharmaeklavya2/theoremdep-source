The alternating group $A_X$ is the set of all even permutations of $X$.

## Proof that $A_X$ is a group

Let $\sigma_1 = \pi_1\pi_2\ldots\pi_{2m}$ and $\sigma_2 = \tau_1\tau_2\ldots\tau_{2n}$ be even permutations.
\[ \sigma_1\sigma_2^{-1}
= \pi_1\pi_2\ldots\pi_{2m}(\tau_1\tau_2\ldots\tau_{2n})^{-1}
= \pi_1\pi_2\ldots\pi_{2m}\tau_{2n}^{-1}\tau_{2n-1}^{-1}\ldots\tau_1^{-1}
= \pi_1\pi_2\ldots\pi_{2m}\tau_{2n}\tau_{2n-1}\ldots\tau_1
\in A_X \]

Therefore, $A_X$ is a subgroup of $S_X$.
