The symmetric group $S_X$ is the set of all permutations of $X$ where the operation is composition of permutations.

## Proof that it is a group

* Closure: Composition of bijections is a bijection.
* Associativity: Function composition is associative.
* Identity: Identity permutation exists.
* Inverse: Inverse permutation exists.
