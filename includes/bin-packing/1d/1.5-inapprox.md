There is no (1.5-Îµ)-approx algorithm for 1D bin-packing unless P=NP.

## Proof

Let $A = \{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\}$ be a partition instance.
Let $B = \left\{\frac{2a_i}{\operatorname{sum}(A)}: a_i \in A\right\}$.

Then $B$ can be packed in 2 bins iff $A$ can be partitioned into equi-sum sets.
This is because a partitioning of $A$ can be used to get a packing of $B$ into 2 bins
and a packing of $B$ into 2 bins can be used to get a partition of $A$.

If there is a $(1.5-\epsilon)$-approx algorithm for bin-packing,
we can use it to decide if $B$ can be packed into 2 bins:
the algorithm will output 2 iff $B$ can be packed into 2 bins.

This would give us a polynomial-time algorithm for solving the partition problem,
which we know is NP-complete. Therefore, we cannot have a $(1.5-\epsilon)$-approx
algorithm for bin-packing unless P=NP.
