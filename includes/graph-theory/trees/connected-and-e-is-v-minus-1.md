An undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ is a tree iff $G$ is connected and $|E| = |V|-1$.

## Proof

If $G$ is a tree, it is connected and $|E| = |V|-1$.

Since in any connected graph $|E| \ge |V|-1$, it is not possible to
delete an edge from $G$ without disconnecting it.
Any connected graph from which deleting any edge disconnects the graph is a tree.
Therefore, $G$ is a tree.
