Every positive number has a prime factorization.

## Proof

Let $n$ be the smallest number without a prime factorization.
1 has the empty factorization. Therefore, $n \ge 2$.

Also, $n$ is not prime, so it can be written as a product of factors other than 1 and itself.
Therefore, all its factors have a prime factorization.
Therefore, $n$ also has a prime factorization.
This is a contradiction, which means all numbers have a prime factorization.
