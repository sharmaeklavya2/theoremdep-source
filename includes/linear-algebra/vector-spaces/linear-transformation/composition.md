Let $S: U \mapsto V$ and $T: V \mapsto W$ be linear transformations.
Then $ST$ is a linear transformation from $U$ to $W$.

## Proof

\[ (ST)(u_1 + u_2) = S(T(u_1 + u_2)) = S(T(u_1) + T(u_2)) = S(T(u_1)) + S(T(u_2)) = (ST)(u_1) + (ST)(u_2) \]
\[ (ST)(cu) = S(T(cu)) = S(cT(u)) = cS(T(u)) = c(ST)(u) \]
