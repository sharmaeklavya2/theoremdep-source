A vector space $V$ over a field $F$ is a set with
a vector addition operation ($V \times V \mapsto V$)
and a scalar multiplication operation ($F \times V \mapsto V$)
which satisfies all of these axioms:

1.  $(V, +)$ is an abelian group.
2.  Scalar associativity: $\forall a \in F, \forall b \in F, \forall v \in V, a(bv) = (ab)v$.
3.  Distributivity: $\forall a \in F, \forall b \in F, \forall v \in V, (a+b)v = (av + bv)$.
4.  Distributivity: $\forall a \in F, \forall u \in V, \forall v \in V, a(u+v) = (au + av)$.
5.  Unit scalar: $1v = v$.

The elements of $V$ are called vectors.
The elements of $F$ are called scalars.
