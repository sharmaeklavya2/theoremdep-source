Let $f$ be an elementary row operation.
Then $f([A|B]) = [f(A)|f(B)]$.

Since $[A_1|A_2|\ldots|A_n] = [A_1|[A_2|[\ldots|A_n]\ldots]]$,
this result can be generalized to
$f([A_1|A_2|\ldots|A_n]) = [f(A_1)|f(A_2)|\ldots|f(A_n)]$.

## Proof

A row operation on $[A|B]$ is equivalent to applying that row operation
on $A$ and $B$ in parallel.
