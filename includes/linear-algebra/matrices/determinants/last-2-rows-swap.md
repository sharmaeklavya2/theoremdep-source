Let $A$ be an $n$ by $n$ matrix.
Let $B$ be the matrix obtained by swapping the last 2 rows of $A$
($\langle n-1 \rangle \leftrightarrow \langle n \rangle$).

Then $|B| = -|A|$.

## Proof

Proof can be found in the book:
'Elementary Linear Algebra', 4th Edition
by Stephen Andrilli and David Hecker,
in Appendix A, Theorem 3.3, page 648.
