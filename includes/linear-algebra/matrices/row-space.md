Let $A$ be a matrix. The row space of $A$ is the set of all linear combinations of the rows of $A$.

The row space is a vector space.

## Proof that row space is a vector space

Let $A$ be an $m$ by $n$ matrix.
Let $V$ be the set of all linear combinations of rows of $A$.
Then $V \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$.

We know that $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a vector space.
Since $V$ is closed under addition and scalar multiplication,
$V$ is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$.
Hence, $V$ is a vector space.
