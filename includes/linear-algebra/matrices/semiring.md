Let $R$ be a semiring. Then $\mathbb{M}_{n, n}(R)$ is a semiring.
Additionally, if $R$ is a ring, then $\mathbb{M}_{n, n}(R)$ is a ring.
If $R$ has a unity, then $\mathbb{M}_{n, n}(R)$ also has a unity.

## Proof

* Addition is closed.
* Addition is commutative.
* Addition is associative.
* Additive identity: Zero matrix
* Multiplication is closed on square matrices.
* Multiplication is associative: See dependencies
* Distributivity: See dependencies

Therefore, $\mathbb{M}_{n, n}(R)$ is a semiring.

If $R$ is a ring, $-A$ is an additive inverse of $A$.
Therefore, $\mathbb{M}_{n, n}(R)$ is a ring.

If $R$ has a unity, the identity matrix $I_n$ is a unity of $\mathbb{M}_{n, n}(R)$.
