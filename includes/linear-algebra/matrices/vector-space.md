Let $F$ be a field.
Then $\mathbb{M}_{m, n}(F)$ is a vector space on $F$.

## Proof

* Addition is closed
* Addition is associative
* Addition is commutative
* Zero matrix exists
* Additive inverse exists

Therefore, $\mathbb{M}_{m, n}(F)$ is an abelian group.

* Scalar product is associative: $r(sA) = (rs)A$.
* Scalar product is distributive: $(r+s)A = rA + sA$ and $r(A+B) = rA + rB$.
* Unit scalar: $1A = A$.

Therefore, $\mathbb{M}_{m, n}(F)$ is a vector space.
