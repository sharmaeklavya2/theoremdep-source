Let $U$ and $V$ be vector spaces over field $F$.
The function $T: U \mapsto V$ is a linear transformation iff it satisfies both of these conditions:

* $\forall x, y \in U, T(x+y) = T(x) + T(y)$.
* $\forall x \in U, \forall c \in F, T(cx) = cT(x)$.

A linear transformation $T$ is called an isomorphism iff it is bijective.
$U$ and $V$ are said to be isomorphic iff an isomorphic linear transformation exists between them.
