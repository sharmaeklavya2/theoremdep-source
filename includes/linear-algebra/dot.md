The dot product of $u$ and $v$ is defined as:
\[ u \cdot v = \sum_{i=1}^n \overline{u_i}v_i \]
where $\overline{u}$ is the conjugate of $u$.
$\overline{u}$ is generally defined to be equal to $u$.
There are a few exceptions, like complex numbers.

$u$ and $v$ are defined to be orthogonal iff $u \cdot v = 0$.
