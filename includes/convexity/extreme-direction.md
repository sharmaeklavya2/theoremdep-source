Two vectors $u$ and $v$ are called collinear iff
$v = \alpha u$ for some $\alpha > 0$.

Let $S$ be a convex set. Let $d$ be a direction of $S$.
$d$ is said to be non-extreme for $S$ iff
there exist non-collinear directions $x$ and $y$ of $S$ and
$\exists \alpha > 0$, $\exists \beta > 0$ such that
$d = \alpha x + \beta y$.
