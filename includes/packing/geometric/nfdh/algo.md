Next-Fit Decreasing Height (NFDH) is an algorithm for 2D geometric bin packing and strip packing.
It sorts items in decreasing order of height and packs them into 'shelves'.
See section 1.5 in <a href="#cite-bansal2009structural" class="cite-ref">[bansal2009structural]</a>
for a complete description of the algorithm.
