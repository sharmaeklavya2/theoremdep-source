For the classical bin packing problem, it is NP-complete to decide
if a set of items can be packed into 2 bins.
Consequently, for any $\varepsilon > 0$, there is no $(1.5-\varepsilon)$-approx
algorithm for classical bin packing unless P=NP.

## Proof

Let $A = \{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\}$ be a partition instance.
Let $B = \left\{\frac{2a_i}{\operatorname{sum}(A)}: a_i \in A\right\}$.

Then $B$ can be packed in 2 bins iff $A$ can be partitioned into equi-sum sets.
This is because a partitioning of $A$ can be used to get a packing of $B$ into 2 bins
and a packing of $B$ into 2 bins can be used to get a partition of $A$.
Since the partition problem is NP-complete, it is NP-complete to decide whether
a set of items can be packed into 2 bins.

If there is a $(1.5-\varepsilon)$-approx algorithm for bin packing,
we can use it to decide if $B$ can be packed into 2 bins:
the algorithm will output 2 iff $B$ can be packed into 2 bins.
Therefore, we cannot have a $(1.5-\varepsilon)$-approx
algorithm for bin packing unless P=NP.
