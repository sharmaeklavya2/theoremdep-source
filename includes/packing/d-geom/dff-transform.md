Let $I$ be a $d$-dimensional geometric bin packing instance.
Let $f_1, f_2, ..., f_d$ be DFFs.
Let $J$ be the bin packing instance where for each item in $I$,
its $i^{\textrm{th}}$ dimension $x$ is replaced by $f_i(x)$.
$J$ is called the DFF transform of $I$.

If $I$ can fit in 1 bin, then so can $J$.

This is mentioned as lemma 2.3 in <a href="#cite-caprara2008packing">[caprara2008packing]</a>,
which includes references to proofs.
