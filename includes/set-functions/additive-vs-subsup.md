Let $f: 2^{\Omega} \to \mathbb{R}$ be a set function. Then

* $f$ is additive iff it is subadditive and superadditive.
* $f$ is additive iff it is submodular and supermodular.

## Proof

It's trivial to see that an additive function is submodular, supermodular, subadditive, superadditive.

Let $X$ and $Y$ be two disjoint sets. By subadditive and superadditivity
(or by submodularity and supermodularity) we get $f(X \cup Y) = f(X) + f(Y)$.
