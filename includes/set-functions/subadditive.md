A set function $f: 2^Ω → ℝ$ is subadditive iff $f(A ∪ B) ≤ f(A) + f(B)$ for all disjoint sets $A$ and $B$.
$f$ is superadditive iff $f(A ∪ B) ≥ f(A) + f(B)$ for all disjoint sets $A$ and $B$.

$f$ is subadditive iff $-f$ is superadditive.

Equivalently, $f$ is subadditive iff $f(B \mid A) ≤ f(B)$ for all disjoint sets $A$ and $B$,
and superadditive iff $f(B \mid A) ≥ f(B)$ for all disjoint sets $A$ and $B$.
