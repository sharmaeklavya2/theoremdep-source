For an extreme-point solution, the maximum number of linearly independent tight constraints
equals the number of non-zero variables.

A useful corollary is that the number of non-zero variables
in an extreme-point solution is at most the number of constraints.

Proof can be found in the book 'Iterative Methods in Combinatorial Optimization'
by Lau, Ravi and Singh, Lemma 2.1.4, page 14.
