The dual of the linear program
\[ P: \max \left\{ c^Tx: Ax \le b, x \ge 0 \right\} \]
is
\[ D: \min \left\{ b^Ty: A^Ty \ge c, y \ge 0 \right\} \]
Also, the dual of $D$ is $P$.

For other kinds of linear programs, the dual can either be obtained by
first converting to standard form, or by applying this method:
