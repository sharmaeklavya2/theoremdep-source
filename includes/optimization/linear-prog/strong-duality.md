For a pair of primal and dual linear programs, exactly one of these is true:

* Both the primal and dual are infeasible.
* The primal is unbounded and the dual is infeasible.
* The primal is infeasible and the dual is unbounded.
* The primal and dual are both feasible and bounded,
    and have the same optimal objective values.
