    "LONG_DESCRIPTION": "TheoremDep contains many theorems and shows you the dependencies for each theorem. Theorem X is said to be dependent on theorem Y iff Y is used as a lemma in the proof of X. Therefore, this website presents proofs in a way which simultaneously achieves the goals of not assuming any prior knowledge and making it easy to skip parts you already know.",
